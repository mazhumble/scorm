# scorm

I first created a learner management system in 2006 using VS2003 therefore I am currently upgrading the existing project (which is not part of github) to use newer technologies. The existing LMS is able to record scores, date completed from SCORM compliant courses for users.
 
The upgraded LMS currently includes:
1.

Once the exisiting project has been updated I hope to create additional features such as:
1. An administrative section allowing users (with the correct permission) to enable/disable features, add new users, add new courses, change default language and colour schemes etc
2. A messaging/forum feature, allowing standard users to discuss course material.

Please feel free to suggest alternative technologies or other additional features.
